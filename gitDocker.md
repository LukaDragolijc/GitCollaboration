## GitHub, Docker, and Automated Testing
Using GitHub, Docker, automated testing, and continuous integration can increase the productivity and competitiveness of a company. GitHub allow users to collaborate independently on a project and merge their components together to create a working repository. Docker lets users host web applications in the cloud using Linux, which allows users online to use said web applications. Automated testing lets employees concentrate on the more valuable tests, while time consuming quantity-based tests are done automatically without input. Continuous integration allows for the steady, incremental development of an application over time to be uploaded to a shared repository. This repository is usable in both automated and manual testing.
